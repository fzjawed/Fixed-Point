I really wanted to do this question using binary search!!! And I was SOOOO close :)

I'll upload my wrong binary search code too if I haven't lost it 

***Question: Given a list of unique integers nums sorted in ascending order, return the minimum i such that nums[i] == i. If there's no solution, return -1.***

I ended up just brute forcing it with a simple for loop. I was trying the binary search method because it said it in the hint so I thought the simple for loop wouldn't be accepted.

I think it'd also be good to update the correct binary search code here too. For future reference.
